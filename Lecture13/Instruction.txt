# This file is all about the how to add requirements 

# if you are working with venv just run a command "pip freeze"

# All the dependencies that you have used for your project can look that

#in the terminal then create a new command "pip freeze > requirements.txt"

# this will automatically create a requirements file in the root directory 

# of your project and then got to "https://github.com" and then create

# a account by signing in if you are already a github user then login with

# your existing account . then create a brand new repo in the github

# and copy the git link from the repository and then move to vs and clone it

# there or in your local folder where you have already your code "to clone

# the repo you just need to write in terminal " "git clone + url of your 

# remote github repo" and then enter your remote repo will automatically

# getting clone into your local system move all your existing file in to

# that repository which you have just clone and then write some command on terminal

# one thing make sure while creating repository you should set .gitignore

# to python. it will be helpful when you will push the repo from local to

# remote server this thing will automatically ignore your secret file which

# contain your confidential information like api's ,secret etc etc. then after

# moving all your code file in to project repository which you just clone and

# then write some command in terminal "git add ." it will add all ypu chnages 

# then commit that add into remote server by using command "git commit -m "comment that you want to use"

# then write the final command "git push origin main" and it will push all

# into your github and boooooom your code is save into your github.

# thats'it and at the end make sure your .env shoudl not be in your github.

# otherwise some else can breache your data and use for their own purpose.

# and requirements.txt file should be there. that's it.
